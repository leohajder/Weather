# Weather

A local weather checker. This is made as an assignment for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) in JavaScript. It features [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons.

## How it works?

The [FreeGeoIP API](http://freegeoip.net/) gets the location, and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) gets the weather report. Register for free to get your app ID. The data is requested via AJAX.  
**NOTE:** Use http instead of https protocol for this to work properly.
