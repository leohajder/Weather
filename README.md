# Weather

A local weather checker made as an assignment for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).

## Resources

-   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
-   [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/)
-   [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
-   [FreeGeoIP API](http://freegeoip.net/)
-   [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
-   [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## How it works

An AJAX request gets a JSON response from FreeGeoIP containing the location data. Then another request gets a JSON response from OpenWeatherMap containing the weather data, with the location parameters passed to it. Register for free to get the required OpenWeatherMap app ID.

## Note

You might have to disable AdBlocker.
