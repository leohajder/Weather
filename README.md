# Weather

A local weather checker. This is made as an assignment for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) in JavaScript. It features [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons and AJAX.

## How does it work?

An AJAX request to the [FreeGeoIP API](http://freegeoip.net/) gets the location, and then another one to the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/), with the result of the first one passed to it, gets the weather report. Register for free to get your OpenWeatherMap app ID.  
**NOTE:** Use http instead of https.
